    "### Part 1.2: Hyper-Parameter analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "___Overview of the program___:\n",
    "The majority of the code is sampled from the '222 problem' example within Unit 3, with alterations to the fitness function, the bit flip mutation and the addition of probability crossover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally I attempted to determine fitness as sum(chromosome) - sum(ascii), where the lower the value returned the more fit the individual, however was finding that whilst it would solve the latter 80-90% of the problem quite easily, it would never get the first couple of bits of the string correct. This fitness function also required running the code with a high population count for alot of generations to return the previously mentioned result, so I decided to try a different fitness function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new fitness function simply checks how many bits in the chromosome match that of the ascii string. The greatest fitness value is 85, where all characters match, and so those with the highest fitness score parent the next generation. With this method, we still maintain a larger population size, however require ___a lot___ less generations, 12 instead of 3000. 12 is just the number of generations I found to be most frequently accurate, along with selecting the 6 most fit individuals to parent the next generation. The other benefit to this fitness function is my bit flip mutation rate is also alot lower, at 0.04 opposed to the 0.1 required with my previous method, which is in part why it can reach a more accurate solution in less generations. My crossover rate is 0.8, as it manages to reach the correct solution in a smaller number of generations. By applying crossover so frequently over such a large population we stand more chance of positive mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Upwards of 95% of the time the most fit individual(s) match the ascii value, however will very occasionally get a single bit incorrect. \n",
    "\n",
    "A drawback of my solution is it might not work with the hyper-parameter values used if applied to a different problem, as it is quite specific to this 85-bit string example. Theoretically, you wouldn't have to alter the code for a similar problem, just the hyper-parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "___Selection___: \n",
    "The selection sample is very small in comparison to the population size to maintain high quality. I trialled values ranging from 5-50 and found 6 to be the most frequently accurate in correlation with my population size and generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "___One Point Crossover___:\n",
    "The one point crossover function behaves exactly as that from the 222 example, randomly dissecting two parents and splicing them to create new offspring. My crossover rate is 0.8 to allow frequent crossover in the hopes of positive mutation\n",
    "\n",
    "___Bit Flip Mutation___:\n",
    "I've found it best to keep the chance of a bit being flipped around the 0.05 value, we want this to be fairly low so that we aren't mistakenly flipping correct bits, but high enough that the program is stochastic and doesn't get stuck on an incorrect answer.\n",
